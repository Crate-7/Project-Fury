- Realizing the limitations of my experience within gamedev, I've decided to begin Project Fury. An idea I've had for quite some time. It should be much more realistic for me to complete than the other two projects within a reasonable timeframe, and will give me the necessary experience I need to truly get deep into those other projects. Project Fury is a Divine Horror Retro FPS where you play as Michael the Archangel. Your duty is to purge evil and redeem souls as you smite through hordes of demons to put an end to Hell on Earth.
- Brainstormed mechanics and artstyle. Scope is clean
